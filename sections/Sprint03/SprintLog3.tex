\chapter{Sprint: 3}
Following sprint 2 where we focused on improving the stability of the underlying
libraries of GIRAF, this sprint will have the same focus since there where a lot
of issues with the build tools. This meant that some tasks could not be resolved
as these are dependent on Artifactory. As such, the goals of the sprint have
been defined as follows:\nl

\say{Continuous integration need to be fully functional, such that gradle can
JAVA libraries corectly.}\nl

\say{Improve stability in libraries, accessibility and usability for apps, to
fulfill user stories 1, 4 and 6.(Med udgangspunkt i de nye user-stories???)}\nl

\say{Server and client library, continue implementation of functionality for
user stories 2, 3 and 4.}\nl

Our main focus on this semester will thus be to continue from the last sprint
and improve the stability of the underlying libraries. However, this is
dependent on Jenkins and Artifactory since, we cannot test this until we can get
the server to build it and thus test it.
