\chapter{Sprint: 3}
The focus of this sprint is to improve the stability of the \lapp\ and the GIRAF
libraries. As our build tools are still not operational, some tasks could not
be resolved as these are dependent on Artifactory. As such, the goals of the
sprint are the same as last sprint, and have been defined as follows:\nl

\say{Continuous integration need to be fully functional, such that gradle can
handle Java libraries correctly.}\nl

\say{Increase the stability of the used libraries and the usability of the
applications, to fulfill user stories 1, 4 and 6.}\nl 

\say{Begin to implement functionality for the server and client libraries, based
on user stories 2, 3 and 4.}\nl

During the second week of this sprint, our build tools (Artifactory and Jenkins)
were repaired. Based on this, our responsibility for this sprint has been
redefined to include implementing new features based on the requirements found
in \autoref{sec:Colab2}, and assessing the changes committed during the first
and second sprint. 
 
\section{Tasks and Solutions}
Based on the requirements found in \autoref{c2req}, and the need to
implementing the REST framework developed by SW613 and SW615, we have been
assigned the tasks shown in \autoref{Tasks3}.

\subsection{T785, T830 - Prevent stack-trace from showing for
users}\label{T785-T830} 
At a meeting, the customers requested that we hide the
\ttt{GirafBugSplashScreen}, as the citizens are confused/uncomfortable with the
large amount of incomprehensible information being suddenly shown on the screen
when an error occurs.\nl

In task \textbf{T671} in \autoref{T672}, we replaced the system for sending
crash logs to Google Analytics, such that whenever the bug splash screen was
shown, it would forward the exception and its message. As the customers no
longer want to be shown the splash screen, we have simply decoupled the two from
each other. The revised code can be seen below in \autoref{BugsplNew}.\nl

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = We use Google Analytics and try to recreate the activity, label = BugsplNew] 
protected void onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState) 
{ 
...
	final Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler defaultUncaughtExceptionHandler =
    	Thread.getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler();

        Thread.currentThread().setUncaughtExceptionHandler(new Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler() {
            @Override
            public void uncaughtException(Thread thread, final Throwable ex) {

                // Sends the exception to google analytics
                sendExceptionToGoogleAnalytics(ex);

                // Restarts the activity
                recreate();
            }
        });
...
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

Because of a customer request, on \textbf{line 15} we attempt to
recreate the \ttt{Activity} which crashed by using the \ttt{Activity's}
\ttt{recreate} method. It should be noted, that based on a future assesment, we
realized that this functionality does not work.

\subsection{T786, T822 - Research and implement grayscale functionality}
Based on user story 2, which is shown in \autoref{UserStoriesGeneral}, we have
been assigned the task to research how it would be possible to make a
global implementation of grayscale in the GIRAF applications.\nl

Following our research, we came up with three different approaches to
implementing grayscale:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create an alternative set of resources for all GIRAF components, which
  make use of a grayscale color scheme.
  \item Apply a transparent gray layer to all GIRAF applications, which would
  make all components less colorful.
  \item Reduce the saturation of all GIRAF component's colors, such that all
  applications would look gray.
\end{enumerate}

Based on the fact that we want to create a global option which is forward
compatible with future GIRAF applications, and the fact that we want
to minimize the amount of added resources, we have chosen the third
option, which is to change the saturation of all GIRAF applications.\nl

We have chosen to implement the grayscale functionality in the \clib, as this
library is included in all GIRAF applications. As such, the core of the
implementation is made in the class \textc{GrayScaleHelper}. Changing a given
screen to grayscale consists of two steps; changing the activity, and changing
the action bar at the top.\nl

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Code used to determine the views for the activity and the top action bar., label = grayEx1] 
public class GrayScaleHelper
{
...
    public static void setGrayScaleForActivity(Activity activity, boolean shouldBeGray){
        View screen = activity.getWindow().getDecorView();
        int barId = activity.getResources().getIdentifier("action_bar_container", "id", "android");
        View bar = screen.findViewById(barId);
        View view = activity.findViewById(android.R.id.content);
        setGray(view,shouldBeGray);
        setGray(bar,shouldBeGray);
    }
...
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

As can be seen in \autoref{grayEx1}, the first step is to identify the
\textc{Views} containing the \textc{Activity} and the top \textc{ActionBar}
respectively. The method \textc{setGrayScaleForActivity} takes a reference to
the \textc{Activity}, and a boolean determining if the \textc{Activity} should
be grayscale. On \textbf{line 5}, the top level \textc{View} is retrieved. On
\textbf{line 6}, the ID for the \textc{ActionBar} is determined. On \textbf{line
7}, the \textc{View} for the \textc{ActionBar} is determined based on the ID. On
\textbf{line 8}, the \textc{View} for the \textc{Activity} is determined.
Finally on \textbf{lines 9-10}, the \textc{setGray} method is called with the
\textc{View} for the \textc{Activity} and the \textc{ActionBar} respectively.
The \textc{setGray} method can be seen in \autoref{grayEx2}.\nl

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Method used to change to color saturation of views., label = grayEx2]
public class GrayScaleHelper {
...
    private static void setGray(View view, boolean state){
        if(state) {
            ColorMatrix cm = new ColorMatrix();
            cm.setSaturation(0); //Set the color saturation to 0
            Paint grayscalePaint = new Paint();
            grayscalePaint.setColorFilter(new ColorMatrixColorFilter(cm));
            // Create a hardware layer with the greyscale paint
            view.setLayerType(LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE, grayscalePaint);
        }else{
            //Removes the grayscale
            view.setLayerType(LAYER_TYPE_NONE, null);
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

In the \textc{setGray} metod in \autoref{grayEx2}, we first use the boolean
\textc{state} to determine if we should set the \textc{view} to grayscale. This
boolean represents the value of a \textc{Switch} button in the settings menu,
which indicates if the option is turned on or off. \textbf{Lines 5-8} are used
to create a \textc{Paint}, which has the color saturation of value zero. On
\textbf{line 10}, a \textc{hardware layer} using the defined \textc{Paint} is
added to the supplied \textc{Activity}, see \autoref{grayScale}.\nl

\figx[0.30]{grayScale}{An example of the grayscale in action}

In order for a given activity to implement grayscale, it needs to have a call to
the \textc{setGrayScaleForActivity} method. An example of this call is
implemented in the \textc{Launcher's HomeActivity} class and can be seen in
\autoref{grayEx3}.\nl

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Setting grayscale by calling the setGrayScaleForActivity method, label = grayEx3] 
private void setGrayscale(){
        SharedPreferences prefs = SettingsUtility.getLauncherSettings(this,
            LauncherUtility.getSharedPreferenceUser(currentUser));

        GrayScaleHelper.setGrayScaleForActivity(this, prefs.getBoolean(
            getString(R.string.toggle_gray_scale_preference_key), true));
    }
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

In \autoref{grayEx3}, we start by retrieving the \lapp's
\ttt{SharedPreferences}.
We then retrieve the boolean from the \ttt{SharedPreferences} using the method
\ttt{getBoolean}, which takes a \ttt{String} as input. As input, we give it the
value of the resource string defined by
\ttt{toggle\_gray\_scale\_preference\_key}. As a fallback, if we can not
retrieve a value, we simply set grayscale to true.
\textc{setGrayScaleForThisActivity} method, to set grayscale for this
application. While not implemented yet, the intention is to supply the boolean
value to other GIRAF applications through the \textc{Intent}, which is used to
launch those applications.\nl

As stated above, in order to change the grayscale setting through the GUI, we
have added a \textc{Switch} button. This settings menu with the added button can
be seen in \autoref{grayScale}, where grayscale has been enabled.  

\subsection{T832, T833 - Upload new libraries to Artifactory and implement them}

Following the breakdown of Artifactory during the first sprint, group SW615 has
been working on restoring Artifactory to its intended state. In the middle of
the third sprint they succeeded in their task and Artifactory can now be
used.\nl

As stated in \autoref{GTools}, our collection of build tools used to work in the
following manner:
The developers committed the code to Git and then went to build it using
Jenkins. Jenkins would automatically retrieve the code from Git and compile it.
If Jenkins succeeded, it would then upload the compiled libraries to
Artifactory. Whenever a library was needed to build the software, both locally
and on Jenkins, a request would be sent to Artifactory, which would then return
the compiled library.\nl

With the current fix to our build setup, we have to build the libraries locally
on our own machines, and then upload them to Artifactory using a shared Gradle
build script, which the server infrastructure group (SW615) has created. This
build script can be seen in \autoref{ArtiBuild1} and \autoref{ArtiBuild2}. \nl

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Start of the shared build script, label = ArtiBuild1] 
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jfrog.buildinfo:build-info-extractor-gradle:3.1.1"
    }
}
apply plugin: 'com.jfrog.artifactory'
apply plugin: 'maven-publish'
group = "dk.aau.cs.giraf"
version = System.properties.VERSION ?: "1.0-SNAPSHOT" // Get version from the jenkins parameter VERSION
println "Version is ${version}"
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'http://jenkins.giraf.cs.aau.dk:8080/artifactory/libs-release'
    }
    maven {
        url 'http://jenkins.giraf.cs.aau.dk:8080/artifactory/libs-snapshot'
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

In \autoref{ArtiBuild1}, on \textbf{lines 1-8} we download the
Gradle-Artifactory bridge plugin \citep{Gradle-Artifactory}. On \textbf{lines
9-11} we apply the plugin, and use the maven-publish plugin, which allows us to
publish to the repository. On \textbf{line 12} we specify the version of the
library on Artifactory.\nl

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Publishing the compiled libraries to Artifactory, label = ArtiBuild2] 
artifactory {
    contextUrl = artifactory_contextUrl
    publish {
        repository {
            username = artifactory_user
            password = artifactory_password
            repoKey = version.endsWith('SNAPSHOT') ? 'libs-snapshot-local' : 'libs-release-local'
        }
        defaults {
            publications('artifacts')
            publishArtifacts = true
        }
    }
    resolve {
        repository {
            repoKey = 'jcenter'
        }
        repository {
            repoKey = 'libs-release'
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

Following the specification of paths and versions, we run the publish command in
\autoref{ArtiBuild2} on \textbf{lines 3-19}. On \textbf{lines 5-7} we specify
the authentication information for Artifactory and the repository the library
should be uploaded to.\nl

This Gradle build-script has been distributed to all libraries, which allows us
to compile the libraries locally, and publish them to Artifactory for future
use.\\
In order to implement the new libraries from Artifactory, the Gradle
build scripts have been changed use both Artifactory's new repositories and the
new names of the libraries.\nl

The main problem encountered during this process has been, that some libraries
were unable to build correctly. During a build, these libraries would always
fail, and would report an error during
\textc{':app:transformClassesWithDexForDebug'}. The reported error specified
that the problem could potentially be solved by changing the target Java version
to Java 7. Following a further study of all the compiled libraries, we determined
that the error was caused by the \textc{meta-database} library having been
compiled with Java 8. As the rest of the GIRAF system is using Java 7, this
caused compatibility issues. After rebuilding the library with Java 7
compatibility, we were able to build our applications without further problems.

\subsection{T834 - Implement the new login screen}\label{LoginXML}
In order to implement the new login screen we used the design made in
\textbf{T731}, see \autoref{LoginScreen}, and adapted an existing unfinished
design of the login screen from a prior semester, see \autoref{OldNewLogin}.
Their design was intended to be implemented along with a profile selection
screen in a two-step fashion. This would allow the user to select their profile
from among their coworkers and then type their password afterwards
\citep[Sec.9.5, p.68-70]{RestLogin}. We chose to continue with our own design as
it is not intended to be used by citizens and can easier be expanded with more
users.

\figx[1]{OldNewLogin}{The indevelopment design from the prior semester}

We modified it to include a \textc{TextView} and an \textc{EditText} for
usernames, added a button to log in, and changed the background to use the
defined GIRAF color scheme. This can be seen in \autoref{NewNewLogin}.

\figx[1.2]{NewNewLogin}{The updated login screen design}

The design does not currently have any functionality as we are currently waiting
on groups SW613 and SW615 to finish implementing their models for communication
with the server.

\subsection{Unfinished and Invalid Tasks}\label{S3Invalid}
\begin{itemize}
  \item T835 - Launcher: Implement model-view-controller
  \begin{itemize}
      \item The purpose of this task is to improve the quality of the GIRAF code
      base, by creating a logical distribution of responsibility among the different
      classes.
      \item While we have begun implementing the model-view-controller architecture
      on parts of the \lapp's \ttt{Activities}, we have not finished this task,
      as it represents an ongoing effort to refactor and improve the GIRAF code base.
  \end{itemize}
  \item T836 - Remove old libraries from artifactory, and begin implementing REST
snapshot.
  \begin{itemize}
      \item The purpose of this task is to begin implementing the finished version
      of the \rlib, which is responsible for handling the
      client-to-server communication.
      \item As this task covers a major development effort, we have chosen to split
      it into a number of new tasks, which will be completed during the 4th sprint.
      In addition, in relation to this task, this sprint has mostly been used to
      discuss the \rlib\ and help the REST framework groups to implement all the
      needed functionality.  
      \end{itemize}
  \item T837 - Rework buttons to not use listeners
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The purpose of this task is to improve the quality of the GIRAF code
    base by removing the need for the GIRAF GUI to use listeners in order to
    execute methods on button presses. This can be done in a simpler and cleaner
    manner, by simple calling the methods from the GUI \ttt{XML} files
    themselves.
    \item While we have begun implementing this approach on parts of the \lapp,
    we have not finished this task, as it represents an ongoing effort to refactor and improve the GIRAF code base.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Retrospective}
As with the former sprints, at the end of the third sprint, we held a meeting
with the other groups in order to evaluate the sprint in relation to the
project goals.\nl

The main problems with this sprint are that our back-end was not
ready to be implemented for most of the sprint, and that our build tools
(Artifactory/Jenkins) did not work until about midway through the sprint.
This resulted in our group only being able to work on theoretical solutions and
implementations to our assigned tasks. When the build tools were finally able to
be used, we rushed to upload the newest libraries to Artifactory, and began
finalizing the solutions which we have been unable to assess during the former
sprints.\nl

Following the build tools being functional, we began implementing the \rlib\ as
well as removing the now deprecated \textc{DB-Lib} library. While we were able
to begin this process at the end of the sprint, the \rlib\ is not yet finished
and is therefore incapable of completely replacing the \textc{DB-Lib} library.

\subsection{Evaluation}
The sprint ended with 50.1\% of tasks being declared resolved, see
\autoref{Burndown3}. A lot of the remaining tasks remain open because of various
reasons, like in our case, they cannot be tested as we are currently working on
implementing the \rlib. 

\figx[0.5]{Burndown3}{The burndown chart for the third sprint}
