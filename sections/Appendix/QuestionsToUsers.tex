\chapter{Questions To Users}
During the first sprint, we held a meeting with the groups SW610 and SW612 in
order to determine a number of questions for the users of GIRAF. These questions
were used in order to gain sufficient user feedback in order to resume
development of GIRAF. The questions which were asked are presented below, and
the answers are discussed in \autoref{sec:Colab2}.

\section{Launcher}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Should the launcher allow for switching between Guardians and Citizens
  without ever needing to login? How do you want the switch to be handled?
  \item Can there be multiple Guradians for a single child?
  \item When changing apps shown and the color scheme used:
  	\begin{enumerate}
  	\item Should this be changed on an individual basis, or for groups of
  	citizens?
  	\item Should we support changing this for groups, and what groups exist?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Login System}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Who are supposed to use the login system?
  	\begin{enumerate}
  	\item Guardians or Citizens?
  	\item Should passwords be for unique for individual users, or for the whole
  	department?
  	\item How long should a login session last for?
  	\item Are you even interested in using passwords? Are any important
  	information stored?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
