\chapter{Code Review Process}\label{CRP}
This is a guide for code reviewers in the Giraf development team. Please
consider and follow these guidelines so we can achieve efficient and correct
code.\nl

\textbf{Before review}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Ask the author of the code if they have indeed annotated and commented
    the code properly.
  \end{itemize}
\textbf{During review}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use the provided template
    \item Review a maximum of 400 lines of code at a time
    \item Use about 60 minutes on these lines of code. No more than 90 though
    \item Take a break after each review session
    \item Do not rush the process
    \item Do not fix it yourself
    \item Record bugs - write one line explaining it in the template 
  \end{itemize}
\textbf{After review:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Follow up with the author on fixing defects
    \item Deliver filled out template document to author and Scrum-team
  \end{itemize}
