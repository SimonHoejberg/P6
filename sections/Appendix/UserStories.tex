% %   \item As one of the children who use the system, i want the system to be as
% %   stable as possible, as my mental problems require that of the tools which i use.
% %   \item As a pedagogue I want the ability to replace pictures and icons for the children in the system.
% %   \item As a pedagogue, it is very important to be able to create a weekly
% %   schedule and manage the tasks the children can see at any given time.
% %   \item As a user of the system, the response time is an important factor.
% %   \item As a pedagogue I would like the ability to access the schedules of the kids’ tablets remotely.
% %   \item As a user of the system, I’d like the interface to be simple, things should never be more than 2-3 taps away.
% %   \item As a pedagogue, I would like the option of adding placeholder tasks, which can then be changed to something else later. This enables the pedagogues to add tasks to a kid’s schedule later on.
% %   \item As a pedagogue, I would like to schedule a day by copying another day.
% %   \item As a pedagogue, I would like to schedule a day using templates.

% %   \item As a user, I would like to be made visually aware of any potential changes made in the schedule.
% %   \item As a user, I would like to have a way of visualising the order of the tasks, i.e. explicitly numbering the tasks, because some kids prefer explicit ordering.
% %   \item As a legal guardian, i would like the option to add notes about the individual children, which will then be available to the pedagogues.
% %   \item As a pedagogue, i would like the option to add notes about the individual children, which will then be available to other pedagogues.
% %   \item As a pedagogue and or legal guardian I would like the more complicated tasks to expand into sub-tasks when pressed.

% % \begin{enumerate}

% % \subsection*{Week Planner}
% % \begin{enumerate}
% %   \setlength\itemsep{0em}
% %   \item As a guardian I would like to add my own pictures as an addition to pictograms, as the citizen might need more specification than what a pictogram allows.

% 		Different kids have different ability to interpret abstract concepts.
% 		Some require specific colours, shapes or objects to be present, 
% 		and some still can’t do with drawings, but rather need literal photos.
% 		For this to work, there should be a way to replace the pictograms in the 
% 		system, for each separate kid.
