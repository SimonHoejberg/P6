\chapter{Launcher Guide}

\textbf{IMPORTANT - There are many ToDo's in the code, we have added most of
them so that the developers next year know what they should work on and fix. We
have also kept the ToDo's from when we received the code, but only if we have
not fixed them.}

\subsubsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Launcher is able to launch the apps a user can access. If the app
  is not installed it opens google play such that it can be installed easily.
  \item The settings part of the Launcher should work, but somehow when we put
  settings up, they are not the same we get next time we start the app. This
  also means that grayscale only works in the Settings activity. This should be
  fixed together with the groups who will continue the work on REST, both the
  Server and the Client-Lib.
  \item The Settings for the list of apps that a user can access does not work
  because we get a stackoverflow from REST and as such the code which makes the
  resource PutRequest is disabled and a ToDo has been added in both classes,
  this should be fixed together with the new REST groups.
  \item The login screen works, but is missing a way to handle a department
  login such that when a department login is used the list of guarding in the
  department is used to select which guarding is used in the launcher. This
  needs to be fully supported by the REST Server and REST Client-Lib.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Short into to the REST conversion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We have removed SharedPreference from all the classes such that no user
  information is stored in such a way. This means that all classes where the
  user was retrieved from a SharedPreference does not work and have thus been
  changed to either user a GetRequest or receive the user from a class higher
  up.
  \item When using the user it should come from a GetRequest or from a higher
  class which has just used a GetRequest. The developer \textbf{should NEVER
  EVER} use the user without first having received the latest version from a
  GetRequest. 
  \item We now pass the user from intent to intent instead of the passing the
  username.
  \item Remember when creating Requests that the error response can be null
  \textbf{or} the networkResponse can be null, this should be checked for in
  each request. We have not done this in every request, but this should be
  fixed by next years developers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Missing / Non finshed features}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Grayscale should also be made to work on the login screen, this could
  be done though the use of a sharedprefercne where the last value of grayscale
  from the last logged in user will be stored and **ONLY** used in the login
  screen.
  \item Each request should check if the error response or networkResponse is
  null before using them.
  \item Settings should be fixed, both the resource PutRequest which is
  currently not working and the setting of apps a user can access.
  \item Better icons for the download of missing apps.
  \item Dialogs should be in grayscale if the rest of the Launcher is in
  grayscale, this bug involves both Launcher and GIRAF Component Lib.
  \item It should not be possible to change user though settings, the changed
  to user should be logged out and the orginal user should be logged in again.
  \item There should be a better way to find the correct icon for an app,
  instead of going through the entire list of apps and comparing it with an
  activity name.
\end{itemize}
