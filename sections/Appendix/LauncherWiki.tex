\chapter{Launcher Guide}\label{WikiLauncher}

\textbf{IMPORTANT - There are many ToDo's in the code, we have added most of
them so that the developers next year know what they should work on and fix. We
have also kept the ToDo's from when we received the code, but only if we have
not fixed them.}

\subsubsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Launcher is able to launch the apps a user can access. If
  the app is not installed it opens Google Play such that it can be installed
  easily.
  \item The settings part of the Launcher should work, but somehow when
  we put settings up, they are not the same we get next time we start the app. This
  also means that grayscale only works in the Settings activity. This
  should be fixed together with the groups who will continue the work on REST,
  both the Server and the REST-API-Client-Lib.
  \item The Settings for the list of apps that a user can access does not work
  because we get a stackoverflow from REST-API-Client-Lib and as such the code
  which makes the resource PutRequest is disabled and a ToDo has been added in
  both classes, this should be fixed together with the new  REST groups.
  \item The login screen works, but is missing a way to handle a
  Department login, such that when a Department login is used,
  the list of Guardians in the Department is used to select
  which Guardian is used in the Launcher. This needs to be fully
  supported by the REST Server and REST-API-Client-Lib.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Short intro to the REST conversion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We have removed SharedPreference from all the classes such that
  no user information is stored in such a way. This means that all classes where the
  user was retrieved from a SharedPreference does not work and have thus
  been changed to either use a GetRequest for a user or receive
  the user from a class higher up.
  \item When using the user it should come from a GetRequest or from a
  higher class which has just used a GetRequest. The developer
  should \textbf{NEVER EVER} use the user without first having received the
  latest version from a GetRequest. 
  \item We now pass the user from Intent to Intent instead of
  the passing the Username.
  \item Remember when creating Requests that the ErrorResponse
  can be null \textbf{or} the networkResponse can be
  null, this should be checked for in each request. We have not done
  this in every request, but this should be fixed by next year's developers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Missing / Non-finshed features}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Grayscale should also be made to work on the login screen, this
  could be done though the use of a SharedPreference where the last
  value of grayscale from the last logged in user will be stored and
  \textbf{ONLY} used in the login screen.
  \item Each request should check if the error response or networkResponse is
  null before using them.
  \item Settings should be fixed. The PutRequest for resources
  is currently not working and the settings for apps in general need more work.
  \item Better icons for the download of missing apps.
  \item Dialogs should be in grayscale if the rest of the
  Launcher is in grayscale, this bug involves both the Launcher
  and Component-Lib.
  \item It should not be possible to change user through settings. The changed
  to user should be logged out and the orginal user should be logged in again.
  \item There should be a better way to find the correct icon for an app,
  instead of going through the entire list of apps and comparing it with the
  name of the app.
\end{itemize}
