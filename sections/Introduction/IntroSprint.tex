\section{Multi-Project Organization Method/Scrum}
\fix{}{Might need a bit of editing depending on how the scrum of scrums
progresses} This semester we have organized the multi-project as a scrum of
scrums. One group serves as the scrum master while the remaining 6 groups each send 1
member. These 10 people meet once every week to discuss the multi-project
and after each sprint decide which tasks from the product backlog are suitable
for the sprint backlog. They then further divide the sprint backlog among the
groups such that each group have a suitable number of tasks for each sprint.\nl
