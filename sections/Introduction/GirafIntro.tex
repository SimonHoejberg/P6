\chapter{Introduction}
The GIRAF project is an ongoing development process, which aims to develop a
number of applications for Android tablets, which are to be used by children
with varying degrees of autism. The project is being developed by bachelor
students at Aalborg University, and has been under development since early 2011.
Each semester, the new bachelor students must work together to analyze the state
of the project, and determine which improvements they intend to implement.

\section{State of GIRAF}

The current implementation of the GIRAF project consists of 10 different
interconnected applications, which are presented below in \autoref{GApps}.

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|p{2.8cm}|p{2.2cm}|p{7cm}|}
\hline
Application			& Description \\\hline
Launcher  			& The main application of GIRAF, controls access
to other GIRAF applications. \\\hline 
Sequence	       	& A tool to create a sequence of pictograms which can
communicate a process.\\\hline 
PictoCreator  	   	& Allows the user to manually create pictograms
which can be saved on the database.\\\hline
PictoReader	   		& A tool which can read the text of an associated
pictrogram aloud.\\\hline
LifeStories	   		& A tool which allows a citizen to describe their day
using pictograms.\\\hline 
Timer     	   		& Allows guardians to create a timer which
limits how long a citizen can use an application.\\\hline 
Weekplanner 		& Allows for the creation of schedules for citizens
using pictograms. \\\hline 
Category Tool		& A tool which allows pictograms to be grouped together
in a specific category. \\\hline 
Category Game   	& A game which teaches citizens to associate
different object by a common feature. \\\hline 
Voice Game  		& A game which allows citizens to control an object
using the volume of their voice. \\\hline
\end{tabular} 
\caption{The development status of the applications available to GIRAF}
\label{GApps}
\end{table}

The previous semester ended with the Voice Game application working as a
standalone in an acceptable state. The other applications are in a working
state, but have several issues, such as bugs and missing features which
prohibit their use by the customer.
  
\section{Project Goals}
During the first meeting with representatives from one of the institutions which
GIRAF cooperate with, we were given a brief introduction to how they curretly
work and interact with the citizens. The majority of their feedback concern a
desire for a working version of GIRAF, especially something that means an
easier time of managing the schedules of citizens. This feedback is the reason
why GIRAF is to be developed as a ``minimum viable product'', with a focus on
the weekplanner, server and database.\nl

The weekplanner is chosen as it is an application that is intended to manage
the citizens' schedules. The core problems present in this application is
the occasional crashes, long load times when browsing for new pictograms and a
sometimes confusing user interface. These issues makes the application currently
unusable for the guardians and citizens. They need the product to be stable and
quick to use, as it needs to be used often and by people with varying degrees of
experience using computers. The server and database is chosen as any sizable
institutions will need an easy, quick and reliable way to transfer data between
devices using GIRAF.

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Implement an acceptable version of the app ``Weekplanner''
%   	\begin{enumerate}
%   		\item Fix possible crashes
%   		\item Identify problems in Weekplanners dependencies
%   		\item Fix bugs in the launcher App
% 	\end{enumerate}
%   \item Simplify the database communication system
%    	\begin{enumerate}
%   		\item Allow for syncronization of data
%   		\item Increase safety of stored data
%   		\item Create a useful base for future student to improve
% 	\end{enumerate}
% \end{itemize}

\section{Organizational Method}

The goals for the project are to make GIRAF a minimal viable product in
regards to the applications and server. These goals are divided among the groups
in such a way that the each group works on a part of the project they want. This
is meant to increase the quality of the work since each group is able to
specialize on a specific part which they want to work on. It also allows the
groups to work easier together since most of them share some common feature.
This leads to the following distribution of labour:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{8cm}|}
\hline
Group & Focus & Description \\ \hline
SW609 & Weekplanner depedencies' & Works on providing stability to
weekplanner and its dependencies.\\\hline 
SW610 & Weekplanner & Works on getting weekplanner into a working
state.\\\hline 
SW611 & Scrum masters & Organizes the scrum meetings. \\\hline 
SW612 & Product owners & Creates and describes tasks, also acts as contact to
customers. \\\hline 
SW613 & REST client & Works on REST client libraries.\\ \hline

SW614 & Infrastructure & Works on getting the server up and running in an way
that can allow it to be easily maintained. \\\hline

SW615 & REST server & \fix{}{figure out what they are doing}\\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{The focus of each of the groups}
\label{GroupDivision}
\end{table}

\subsection{Our Goals}

As can be seen in \autoref{GroupDivision}, our group will focus on improving the
stability of the weekplanner through fixing the bugs and refactoring the code
written in its dependencies. This is mainly done through work on the Launcher
and PictoSearch applications.

\subsubsection{Launcher}\label{LauncherReview}
\fix{}{Depending on how much we actually work with the launcher we might remove
some of the unnecessary explanations} The launcher as of February 2017 contains
a login screen, different menues for each of the user types and an options menu. The user is able to login using a QR
code, as can be seen in \autoref{Login}.In the lower left corner there is
currently a shortcut used for testing purposes which skips the QR code. There
was work done in the prior semester towards a login system using passwords
instead of using QR codes. This includes design sketches and a simple UI
implementation.

\figx[0.25]{Login}{The login screen shows a pictogram of someone scanning a QR
code while the user can see what it scans.}

After logging in, the user is taken to the guardian menu, which has access to 4
buttons and a list of applications which the user has access to,
see \autoref{MenuGuardian}. Guardian and citizens have similar menus with
exception that citizens only have access to button \textbf{2} and \textbf{3}.

\figx[0.32]{MenuGuardian}{The guardians menu screen.}
% This picture is smaller than the others

Button \textbf{1} allows the guardian to change the current profile with that of
one of the citizens under its care, see \autoref{ChooseCitizen}. There is currently no
similar button on the citizens menu, this means that a citizen cannot be changed
back to a guardian without logging out.

\figx[0.25]{ChooseCitizen}{The menu changes the guardian to one its citizens.}

Button \textbf{2} allows the user to log out. Button \textbf{3} provides the
user with a quick description of each of the other buttons. Button \textbf{4}
provides access to the settings, see \autoref{OptionsGuardian}, which is a
collection of menus regarding how many and which applications can the be shown
on \textbf{5} in \autoref{MenuGuardian}. 

\figx[0.32]{OptionsGuardian}{The settings menu}

The settings menu has a collection of universal buttons which can be accessed
from every menu except button \textbf{5}. Button \textbf{1} allows the guardian
to exit the settings menu, button \textbf{2} allows the guardian to change the settings for
the citizens in its care. This leads to a settings menu similar to the guardians.
Button \textbf{3} allows the guardian to control how many applications are
shown for the current user, which can be seen in \textbf{7}. Button \textbf{4}
allows the guardian to control which applications are shown to user. This is
divided into GIRAF, Android and Store applications, see
\autoref{OptionsGuardian2}. Button \textbf{6} as in the other menus provide the
user with a quick description of each of the other buttons.

\figx[0.25]{OptionsGuardian2}{The menu which allows the guardian to show }

\subsubsection{PictoSearch}\label{PictoSearchReview}
As of March 2017, the \textc{pictosearch-lib} is a library containing all
classes relating to the search of pictograms. As it is a library, it does not
represent a single application, but is implemented in projects such as
\textc{weekday-planner} and \textc{pictoreader}.\nl

The pictosearch library's visual components consists of a number of
elements. At the top right is a search-bar, which is used to search for
pictograms by name. To the left is a vertical bar used to showcase what
pictograms the user have selected. The large scrollable area in the middle of
the screen is used to showcase all the pictograms which correspond to the given
search criteria. All of these elements can be seen below in
\autoref{psearchScrn}.
 
\figx[0.3]{psearchScrn}{Graphical user interface for the pictosearch library.}

After choosing a number of pictograms, the user can click the green checkmark in
the top right corner, and the respective \textc{Pictogram} objects are passed to
the parent application.

\subsection{Development Method}

Based on the experiences from the previous semester's students, we choose to
make use of an agile developement process, where each group is organized through
the use of Scrum. This means that the development process is divided into a
number of ``sprints'', in which no more tasks can be added to the backlog, and
the groups work to resolve all currently defined tasks. We have organized the
multi-project this semester as a scrum of scrums. One group serves as the scrum
master while the remaining 6 groups each send 1 member, see
\autoref{ProjectStruct}.

\figx[0.80]{ProjectStruct}{The project structure used this semester.}

These 10 people meet once every week to discuss the multi-project and after each
sprint decide which tasks from the product backlog are suitable for the sprint
backlog. They then further divide the sprint backlog among the groups such that
each group have a suitable number of tasks for each sprint. The multi-project
itself is divided into 4 different sprints, as can be seen in
\autoref{TableActivity}. 

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Activity & Date \\ \hline
1. Sprint & 20/2 - 15/3 \\\hline 
2. Sprint & 15/3 - 7/4\\\hline 
3. Sprint & 7/4 - 1/5\\\hline 
4. Sprint & 1/5 - 22/5\\\hline 
Project delivery date & 29/5\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The GIRAF activities and their dates.}

\end{table}

Based on this development framework, this report will be used to document and
reason about the different needed improvements, which have been assigned to our
group, SW609.
