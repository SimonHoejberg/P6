\subsection{General Reading Guide}
When reading the report both sprint 1 and 2 should be read lightly, as most of
the developed solutions have been theoretical and have been changed because of
the switch to \textc{REST} in sprint 3 and 4. During the reading of the second
sprint, before \autoref{DesignLogin} the reader could beneficial read the second
collaboration in \autoref{sec:Colab2} to better understand how the new login screen and its requiments
came to be. Then the rest of sprint 2 should be read. Before reading sprint 3, you should read
\autoref{S1CS} to get an understanding of what \textc{REST} is in
the context of application development. Then the reader should continue with
reading sprint 3 and 4 in depth, most of the development in sprint 3 is still
relevant.

\subsection{Reading Guide for Future Students}
The future students shoul read the collaboration in \autoref{S1CS} in order to
understand how the \textc{REST-Api-Client-Lib} works, and the ideas behind its
design. As such, it should be read before reading sprint 3 and 4. The other
collaboration can be read lightly but is not necessary. They should then read
from \autoref{LoginXML} in sprint 3 to the end of sprint 4. The other sprints
can be read lightly, most of what has been developed in those sprints has
changed in the last two sprints and is therefore not releavant to maintain the
\textc{Launcher}.
