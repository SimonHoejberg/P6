\section{Reading Guide}
This section provides an overview of which order the different parts of the
report should be read and provides a list of the various terms used throughout
the report.

\subsection{Style List}
The following font styles are used throughout the report, and has the following meaning:

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{6cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Style} & \textbf{Meaning} \\ \hline
\textc{Code} &  Code related elements e.g. libraries, methods, and classes.\\ \hline
\textbf{TXXX} & Tasks Reference \\\hline
\textbf{line x-y} & Line reference in code \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Notable font styles}
\end{table}


\subsection{Word List}

client.\\\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{General Reading Guide}
When reading the report both sprint 1 and 2 should be read lightly, as most of
the developed solutions have been theoretical and have been changed because of
the switch to \textc{REST} in sprint 3 and 4. During the reading of the second
sprint, before \autoref{DesignLogin} the reader could beneficial read the second
collaboration in \autoref{sec:Colab2} to better understand how the new login screen and its requirements
came to be. Then the rest of sprint 2 should be read. Before reading sprint 3, you should read
\autoref{S1CS} to get an understanding of what \textc{REST} is in
the context of application development. Then the reader should continue with
reading sprint 3 and 4 in depth, most of the development in sprint 3 is still
relevant.

\subsection{Reading Guide for Future Students}
The future students should read the collaboration in \autoref{S1CS} in order to
understand how the \textc{REST-Api-Client-Lib} works, and the ideas behind its
design. As such, it should be read before reading sprint 3 and 4. The other
collaboration can be read lightly but is not necessary. They should then read
from \autoref{LoginXML} in sprint 3 to the end of sprint 4. The other sprints
can be read lightly, most of what has been developed in those sprints has
changed in the last two sprints and is therefore not relevant to maintain the
\textc{Launcher}.

\section{Download and Compile the Git Reposotiories}
In this section we present a small guide to downloading and making the code
compile. We assume the reader has already set up Android Studio, Git and the
Android SDK correctly. Note we can not guranty that the code will compile unless you are
connected to AAU-1X because of the way Artifactory is set up and that the
code on these repositoriees will be our code for years to come.\nl

The two repositories which we have worked on to the end are

\begin{itemize}
  \item GIRAF Launcher -
  \url{http://git.giraf.cs.aau.dk/Giraf-AndroidApps/launcher}
  \item GIRAF Component-Lib -
  \url{http://git.giraf.cs.aau.dk/Giraf-AndroidLibs/giraf-component-lib}
\end{itemize}

The steps to download the code and make it compile are
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Go to one of the repoitoires and click on the button highlighted on
  \autoref{gitCheckoutLink}
  \figx{gitCheckoutLink}{The way to copy the Git clone link}
  \item Then you open Android Studio such that you see the screen shown on
  \autoref{ASmain}
  \figx{ASmain}{The window when you open Android Studio without a project}
  \item You then select the item shown on \autoref{ASmain} which will open this
  dialog see \autoref{AS2}
  \figx{AS2}{The clone dialog in Android Studio}
  \item Here in the dialog \autoref{AS2} you paste the url which was copied
  though step 1 into the box marked wth the red square and then click on the button
  marked with the blue square. 
  \item On the popup dialog which asks if you want to open it press ``Yes''
  \item On the next popup dialog just press ``OK''
  \item Then import all modules.
  \item When the proccesses is finished the code is ready to be inspected
  and compiled
  \item Then to compile and run the app, click on the Green play arrow which
  will start the runing of the app and present a dialog where you can choose
  between real devices or emulators.
\end{enumerate}
