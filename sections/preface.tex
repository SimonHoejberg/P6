\section{Reading Guide}
This section provides an overview of which order the different parts of the
report should be read and provides a list of the various terms used throughout
the report.

\subsection{Style List}
The following font styles are used throughout the report, and has the following meaning:

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{6cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Style} & \textbf{Meaning} \\ \hline
\textc{Code} &  Code related elements e.g. libraries, methods, and classes.\\ \hline
\textbf{TXXX} & Tasks Reference \\\hline
\textbf{line x-y} & Line reference in code \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Notable font styles}
\end{table}


\subsection{Word List}

at the Centre for Autism\\ \hline
REST &  REST stands for Representational State Transfer and for us is used to
reference the framework which is used to request information from the database\\\hline
REST Framework & This is used as a shorthand to refer to the REST server and
client.\\\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{General Reading Guide}
When reading the report both sprint 1 and 2 should be read lightly, as most of
the developed solutions have been theoretical and have been changed because of
the switch to \textc{REST} in sprint 3 and 4. During the reading of the second
sprint, before \autoref{DesignLogin} the reader could beneficial read the second
collaboration in \autoref{sec:Colab2} to better understand how the new login screen and its requirements
came to be. Then the rest of sprint 2 should be read. Before reading sprint 3, you should read
\autoref{S1CS} to get an understanding of what \textc{REST} is in
the context of application development. Then the reader should continue with
reading sprint 3 and 4 in depth, most of the development in sprint 3 is still
relevant.

\subsection{Reading Guide for Future Students}
The future students should read the collaboration in \autoref{S1CS} in order to
understand how the \textc{REST-Api-Client-Lib} works, and the ideas behind its
design. As such, it should be read before reading sprint 3 and 4. The other
collaboration can be read lightly but is not necessary. They should then read
from \autoref{LoginXML} in sprint 3 to the end of sprint 4. The other sprints
can be read lightly, most of what has been developed in those sprints has
changed in the last two sprints and is therefore not relevant to maintain the
\textc{Launcher}.

\section{Download and Compile the Git Repositories}
In this section, we present a small guide on how to download and compile the
GIRAF code. We assume the reader has already set up Android Studio, Git, and the
Android SDK correctly. Note that we can not guarantee that the code will compile
unless you are connected to AAU-1X. This is because of the way Artifactory is
set up. It should also be noted that we cannot guarantee that the
repositories will contain the correct code in the future, as the students on
next year's project can delete/modify the code as they wish.\nl

The two repositories which we have worked on are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item GIRAF Launcher -
  \url{http://git.giraf.cs.aau.dk/Giraf-AndroidApps/launcher}
  \item GIRAF Component-Lib -
  \url{http://git.giraf.cs.aau.dk/Giraf-AndroidLibs/giraf-component-lib}
\end{itemize}

The steps to download the code and make it compile are
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Go to one of the repositories and click on the button highlighted on
  \autoref{gitCheckoutLink}
  \figx[0.9]{gitCheckoutLink}{The way to copy the Git clone link}
  \item Then you open Android Studio such that you see the screen shown on
  \autoref{ASmain}
  \figx[0.7]{ASmain}{The window when you open Android Studio's main launcher}
  \item You then select the item shown on \autoref{ASmain} which will open this
  dialog see \autoref{AS2}
  \figx[0.7]{AS2}{The clone dialog in Android Studio}
  \item In \autoref{AS2} you paste the url which was copied
  in step 1 into the box marked wth the red square and then click on the button
  marked with the blue square. 
  \item On the popup dialog, which asks if you want to open it, press ``Yes''.
  \item On the next popup dialog press ``OK''.
  \item Then import all modules.
  \item When the processes are finished the code is ready to be inspected
  and compiled.
  \item To compile and run the app, click on the Green play arrow which
  will start the runing of the app and present a dialog where you can choose
  between real devices or emulators.
\end{enumerate}
