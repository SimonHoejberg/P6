Notes 1 meeting.\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item At the meeting we started by taking about the different resources that we need
for our apps.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Users
  \item Pictograms
\end{itemize}
\item There is a diagram somewhere of the resources.
\item Then we talked about which resources that should be able to do something
from rest (I mean it should be update, delet, creat but I am not 100p sure).
\end{itemize}
