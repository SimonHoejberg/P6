\subsection{Design}

This subsection will be used to describe the design process used to create the
new login system. The design is based on a design manual created a previous
year. The purpose of the design manual is to create some design guidelines, such
that every application is recognizable as a GIRAF application. Therefore, the
design manual contains a set of rules of how for example the colour scheme which
is supposed to be used. Another example of the design guidelines is how the
structure of the application is to be made, for example the back button which
should always be placed as the left-most button at the top. Furthermore, the
back button should always be the same see \autoref{icon_back}.

Based on the design guidelines and the requirements found in
\autoref{LoginRequirements} we created a mock up for the new login system,
see \autoref{LoginScreen}. Furthermore, we use the informal requirements to
create a diagram of the login procedure see \autoref{LoginDiagram}. Using this
diagram we want to show how the different users interact with the login system,
for example if a guardian is inactive for more than 20 minutes they will
automatically be directed to the login screen. It also shows how the interaction
is between the guardian and the citizen, thus a guardian can switch user to a
citizen but a citizen can only become inactive or logout. Another thing is that
a citizen cannot go from inactive to logged out, which means that a citizens
session will never expire.

We add the following buttons on login since we need to allow for the
following methods for reaching the login.
