\section{Git}
The last years students left the Giraf project in many different repositories on
the Giraf git server. This year the different repositories have been forked to
new repositories, because we did not have acces to last years repositories.The
new forked repositories and renamed such that they are easiere to both find and
manage, they have also been diveded in new git organisations such that one group 
can manage access to the different repositories for each Giraf group and member.\\

The new git organistations that have been made are 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Giraf17-Rest
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Contains the repositories for the Rest client / server and other Rest
  stuff
\end{itemize}
  \item Giraf17-Tools
