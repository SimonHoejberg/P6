\subsection{Jenkins and Artifactory}
In order to automate and simplify building the GIRAF software releases, the
GIRAF project is organized using a combination of the tools Jenkins and Artifactory.\nl

Jenkins is a build tool, which takes the GIRAF code base from the relevant Git
repositories, and compiles them into the respective binary files. After
compilation, Jenkins uploads the compiled applications and libraries to
Artifactory's repository. This repository is used to contain the
successful builds of the applications and libraries. The benefit of using
Artifactory is, that it is not necessary for each member of the GIRAF project
to have a local copy of a specific version of the application's /librarie's
dependencies repository. Instead, during a local build a request can be sent to
Artifactory, which returns the dependencies for the apps and libaries such that
they can use the newest stable version.

% Jenkins is used to build the different tools, apps and libaries from the git
% repositories and then publish them to articatory. Artifactory is used to get the

% version.
