\subsection{Phabricator}
As a part of organizing the GIRAF project, we have chosen to make use of a
project management system called Phabricator\nl

Phabricator is an open-source web based suite of tools, which is specialized in
simplifying collaboration between groups/individuals during software development
\cite{phabricator}. The main tool used in the GIRAF project is the SCRUM-boards,
which are used to represent the different tasks that each group is assigned.
This feature makes Phabricator very useful, since the project is divided into 4
sprints, which are managed using the SCRUM management approach.
In each of these planned sprints, each group is assigned a number of tasks,
which will show up on their specialized SCRUM-board. As such, Phabricator allows
the SCRUM managemet group (SW611) to dynamically assign tasks to the relevant
groups.
