\section{Phabricator}
Phabricator is an open-source web based suite of tools for collaboration under
development. Phabricator contains a lot of tools, which can help to make the
collaboration easier. An example of how Phabricator makes the collaboration
easier is by having a built in tool for SCRUM. This is very useful since we use
SCRUM to plan the project, as mentioned earlier the project is divided into 4
sprints. In theese sprints each group is assigned a number of tasks which can be
found in Phabricator. \cite{phabricator}
