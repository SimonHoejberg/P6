\chapter{Sprint: 01}
As this sprint represents the groups' initial experiences with the GIRAF
project, the purpose of this initial sprint is to gain a better understanding of
the inner workings of the various GIRAF apps, and to make sure that the quality
of the previosly written code is up to par. As such, the tasks for this sprint
are mostly superficial, but they do also include a number of fixes to critical
bugs.\nl

As part of the initial organization of the project, each group was assigned a
general area of responsibility. For our group, SW609, this responsibility
encompasses the apps \textc{Launcher} and \textc{Pictogram Searcher}. While
these apps represent our core responsibilities, not all of our tasks are
required to revolve around these apps.

\section{Tasks}
Based on our area of responsibility and the backlog from last semesters'
students, we have chosen an initial list of tasks, which can be seen below in
\autoref{SO1:Tasks}. 

\begin{table}[H]

In the following subsections, we will elaborate upon each of the task, and
document what actions we have taken in order to resolve the issues.

\subsection{T631 - Planner and Launcher: CheckStyle}
In order to increase the quality and readability of the previously written code,
all the groups on this semester have chosen to make use of a generalized code
style, which will be enforced by the IntelliJ plugin CheckStyle.\\
As such, the purpose of this task is to used the CheckStyle plugin to identify
all instances where the code deviates from the agreed upon code style, and
manually refactor it such that the whole code base is uniformly written.\nl

When CheckStyle is executed on a project, it uses an XML file where the code
style is defined, to identify all cases where the code deviated from this
defined style. This information is presented in an ordered list. An example of
an error-list for the \textc{Launcher project} can be seen below in
\autoref{CodeStyleErrors}.

\figx[0.85]{CodeStyleErrors}{List of code style deviations in the Launcher
project.}

In order to solve the problems with the unsystematic code style, we have
methodically resolved the issues identified by CheckStyle.
