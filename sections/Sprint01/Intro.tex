\chapter{Sprint: 01}
As this sprint represents the groups' first experiences with the GIRAF
project, the purpose of this initial sprint is to gain a better understanding of
the inner workings of the various GIRAF apps, and to make sure that the quality
of the previosly written code is up to par. As such, the tasks for this sprint
are mostly superficial, but they do also include a number of fixes to critical
bugs.\nl

At as part of the initial organization of the project, each group was assigned a
general area of responsibility. For our group, SW609, this responsibility
encompasses the \textc{Launcher} and \textc{Pictogram Searcher}.

\section{Tasks}
Based on our area of responsibility, we have chosen an initial list of tasks,
which can be seen below in \autoref{SO1:Tasks}.
