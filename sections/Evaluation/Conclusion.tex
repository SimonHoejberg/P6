\chapter{Conclusion}
This chapter will be used to conclude on the final state of the project, and the
success of the project and sprint goals. \\
Throughout the project, we have been working in collaboration with the 6 other
bachelor groups, in order to further develop the GIRAF suite of Android
applications.\nl

To make an initial conclusion on the success of the project; while we have been
unable to finalize GIRAF to such a state that it can be distributed to users, we
have managed to complete a large part of the project and sprint goals.
Additionally, our group has been able to finish the Launcher, with the exception
of some functionality, which can't be implemented yet, as it lacks the correct
data-objects on the database.\nl

The following sections will conclude to the individual system parts, in relation
to their current state, and what improvements and changes we have made to them
during the span of the project.\nl

In the final state of GIRAF, we have mostly finished our goals, but based on
problems with the finalization of the REST framework, we have been unable to
implement all of the features which are necessary in order to make a realase
version of the GIRAF system.
