\chapter{Sprint: 4}


Implementing REST --> We can't make a request handler due to not being able to
use lambda expression since we don't use java 8.
This means we have to Responses within responses since we need some error
handling

\subsection{T772: Verify: Security problem when changing system date/time}
The orginal problem discoved during sprint 2 as seen in \autoref{T772} was that
the user could extend the login session by doing back in time on the device.
This issue is because we do not check the time using some form of a time server,
and therefor not able to detect this.  
But now this task is invalid because the server now handles if a user is logged
in, using tokens / cookies which the rest libary handes.
