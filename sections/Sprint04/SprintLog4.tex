\chapter{Sprint: 4}

Following sprint 3 where we once again focused on adding stability to the
various GIRAF libraries, the focus for this sprint is to allow the next students
to have an easier and more efficient start than our own. Each year the various
libraries increase in size and complexity, and it becomes increasingly
important for new students to understand the code quickly. As such, the goal
for this sprint is to:

\say{The hand over to next years students allows understand the project
quickly.}\nl

For us this means that we will need for REST to be implemented and working
in the various libraries, as well as document the changes and additions.


\section{Tasks and Solutions}

Based on this goal we have been assigned the following tasks, see
\autoref{Tasks3}, which include the verification of our various solutions from
earlier sprints.

In the following subsections we will discuss the tasks and document our
solutions.


\subsection{T772: Verify: Security problem when changing system date/time}
The orginal problem discoved during sprint 2 as seen in \autoref{T772} was that
the user could extend the login session by doing back in time on the device.
This issue is because we do not check the time using some form of a time server,
and therefor not able to detect this.  
But now this task is invalid because the server now handles if a user is logged
in, using tokens / cookies which the rest libary handes.

The goal of this task is to ensure that the next students can easily 


Found and read the old version
Looked at discrepencies between the new layout and what is described
Result: Mostly visual, thus updated pics and text to reflect.

\subsection{T868: REST: Fix Launcher app}
Implementing REST --> We can't make a request handler due to not being able
to use lambda expression since we don't use java 8.
This means we have to Responses within responses since we need some error
handling, although later in the sprint a sort of solution to the problem have
been made, but this was so late that all places where we uses rest we already
have implementen it using the other but still supported way of doing requests.
