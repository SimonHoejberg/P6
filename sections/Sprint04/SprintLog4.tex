\chapter{Sprint: 4}

Following sprint 3 where we once again focused on adding stability to the
various GIRAF libraries, the focus for this sprint is to allow the next students
to have an easier and more efficient start than our own. Each year the various
libraries increase in size and complexity, and it becomes increasingly
important for new students to understand the code quickly. As such, the goal
for this sprint is to:

\say{The hand over to next years students allows understand the project
quickly.}\nl

For us this means that we will need for REST to be implemented and working
in the various libraries, as well as document the changes and additions.


\section{Tasks and Solutions}

Based on this goal we have been assigned the following tasks, see
\autoref{Tasks3}, which include the verification of our various solutions from
earlier sprints.

\end{table}

In the following subsections we will discuss the tasks and document our
solutions.


\subsection{T772: Verify: Security problem when changing system date/time}
The orginal problem discoved during sprint 2 as seen in \autoref{T772} was that
the user could extend the login session by doing back in time on the device.
This issue is because we do not check the time using some form of a time server,
and therefor not able to detect this.  
But now this task is invalid because the server now handles if a user is logged
in, using tokens / cookies which the rest libary handes.

\subsection{T785: Verify: Handle crash such that the user does not get an error message and
is brought back to the launcher}
Thoughout testing the finished launcher after the rest api was included, we see
that when we get an exception we do not crash and show the bug screen, which
would also be funky because the code does not exist to show the bugscreen, and
return to the launcher code has not been tested yet ( kommentar til os selv,
det kode virker heller ikke efter hensighten, det skal lige fixes)

\subsection{T822}

\subsection{T830: Never show the bug screen}
This task should still be fixed given that we removed that code in sprint 3

\subsection{T836: Remove old libraries from artifactory, and begin implementing REST
snapshot}
We have not removed the old libraries from artifactory, because some of the
older apps might still need them in the transition to the new rest api. But they
are no longer used as a deprendecy in the launcher or giraf component lib and we
have implementet not just the rest snapshot but the full rest relase which can
be seen how we use it in the rest fix launcher.

\subsection{T865: Update the Google Store guide}
\fix{Can properly be placed in a subsection along with the other guides}{}

This task is part of the overall goal to ensure that next years students are
well equipped to begin working on GIRAF. The goal of this task is to update the
guide on releasing builds to Google Store. By reading the guide from 2015 and
comparing the pictures in it with Google Stores current design, we can see that
it has changed quite a bit since the guide was written. All the changes of
importances were due to additional tabs which moved various parts of the
functionality. We then updated the pictures and along with the relevant part of
text to better reflect the new design.

\fix{Consider if we need to add pics - it was very minor work after all}{}

\subsection{T868: REST: Fix Launcher app}
Implementing REST --> We can't make a request handler due to not being able
to use lambda expression since we don't use java 8.
This means we have to Responses within responses since we need some error
handling, although later in the sprint a sort of solution to the problem have
been made, but this was so late that all places where we uses rest we already
have implementen it using the other but still supported way of doing requests.
We have also remove all the usage of profiels and switched them out for users
from the new rest model libray.

code show an example of how we use reqeuest

\subsection{T870 - REST: Fix component-lib}
To fix the component lib we only really need to fix a small number of classes
which uses the old database (Jonas du ved hvilke classe som du har rettet i)

\subsection{T872}

\subsection{T873}

\subsection{T875 - Launcher: Add functionality to Log In screen}
This task is centered around adding functionality to the login screen we made
in \fix{add autoref}{}.

%overall
The login procedure is handled by first using our getting a \textc{request
queue}, which is discussed in \fix{}{have a chapter discussing this}. We then
begin with the login request, which takes as an input: a username, a password,
an OnResponse listener and an OnError listerner. The username and password are
taken from the text fields where the user has written them. 

%OnResponse chains
In the OnResponse listener, which we reach if the login request is validated, we
then proceed with a user request, where we again input a username, a password,
an OnResponse listener and an OnError listener. In the OnResponse listener we
will upon validation receive the user as a user-type object called response. We
then proceed to start the home activity \fix{add more}{}.

%OnError
blablabla

%institute screen
An additional requirement is needed as it we need a way for an institute-level
user to\ldots. 



%Tanker:
%implementer login button via:
%Login request --> user request --> home activity
%(Refer til steder hvor vi har beskrevet requestsne?)

% Ny implementation til institution --> login request --> user request hvor user
% nu er af typen institution --> user selection screen Vi genbruger en
% user_selection screen
