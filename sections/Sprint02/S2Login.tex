% This section will be used to describe the different phases of designing the new
% login screen.
% 
% \subsection{Collaboration Introduction}
% This collaboration is between us group (SW609) and groups SW610 and SW612. The
% collaboration started with a meeting were we could ask some questions about the
% user interface and what the customer expects from the GIRAF Launcher and
% Weekplanner. \\
% Group SW612 is in the collaboration since they are the Product Owner. This means
% that they are responsible for the communication between us and the users. In
% this scenario 
% 
% We use the following user stories for designing the login:
% \begin{table}[H]
% \begin{tabular}{|c|p{12.5cm}|}
% \hline 
% \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Launcher}\\
% \hline
% 1. & As a guardian I would like the login button to let a citizen tap to log in
% as a citizen, and hold to login as a guardian, only providing login information
% at that point. \\ \hline
% \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Login}\\ \hline
% 1. & As a guardian I would like not have a Quick-Response (QR) code for login,
% but a regular password instead.\\ \hline
% 2. & As a guardian I would like the ability to set a password for specific users
% of the system.\\ \hline
% 3. & As a guardian I would like the system to automatically log me out of my
% account after a set time limit (approx. 20 min).\\ \hline
% 4. & As a citizen I would like the system not to log me out automatically.\\ \hline
% 5. & As guardian I would like the option to make a specific device always login
% into a citizen's account without password.\\ \hline
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}
% 
% \subsection{Design}
% 
% On previous semester some design guide lines has been created these can be
% found in, \fix{see,}{Reference to the design manual}. We then use the design
% guidelines to design the login screen, see \autoref{LoginScreen}. This mock up
% will act as a reference for when we need to program the actual login system,
% this will also work as prototype such that other groups can validate this
% design. 
% \figx{LoginScreen}{Mock up for the login screen}
% 
% We add the following buttons on login since we need to allow for the
% following methods for reaching the login.

% Group SW612 is in the collaboration since they are the Product Owner. This means
% that they are responsible for the communication between us and the users. Thus
% after having had the meeting with the two other groups, group SW610 had a
% meeting with some of the users. On this meeting they tried getting some answers
% on some of the questions we had. This ended up with them creating some user
% stories see \autoref{UserStoriesLogin}. We use the user stories to figure out
% the functionality and looks of the new login screen.
