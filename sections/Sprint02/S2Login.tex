\subsubsection{Login}

We use the following user stories for designing the login:
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{12.5cm}|}
\hline 
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Launcher}\\
\hline
1. & As a guardian I would like the login button to let a citizen tap to log in
as a citizen, and hold to login as a guardian, only providing login information
at that point. \\ \hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Login}\\ \hline
1. & As a guardian I would like not have a Quick-Response (QR) code for login,
but a regular password instead.\\ \hline
2. & As a guardian I would like the ability to set a password for specific users
of the system.\\ \hline
3. & As a guardian I would like the system to automatically log me out of my
account after a set time limit (approx. 20 min).\\ \hline
4. & As a citizen I would like the system not to log me out automatically.\\ \hline
5. & As guardian I would like the option to make a specific device always login
into a citizen's account without password.\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Design}

On previous semester some design guide lines has been created these can be
found in, \fix{see,}{Reference to the design manual}. We then use the design
guidelines to design the login screen, see \autoref{LoginScreen}.
\figx{LoginScreen}{Mock up for the login screen}

We add the following buttons on login since we need to allow for the
following methods for reaching the login.
