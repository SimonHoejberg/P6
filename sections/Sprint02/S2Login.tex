\subsection{Login}

We use the following user stories for designing the login:

Launcher:
1. As a guardian I would like the login button to let a citizen tap to log in as
a citizen, and hold to login as a guardian, only providing login information at that point.

Login:
1. As a guardian I would like not to have a Quick-Response (QR) codes for login,
but a regular password instead.
2. As a guardian I would like the ability to set a password for specific users
of the system.
3. As a guardian I would like the system to automatically log me out of my
account after a set time limit (approx. 20 min).
4. As a citizen I would like the system to not to log me out automatically.
5. As a guardian I would like the option to make a specific device always log
into a citizen's account without password.

\subsubsection{Design}

The design manual made from previous semester is then used as a guide,
\fix{}{refere to design manual on wiki?}. This leads to the following paper
prototype of the login screen.

We add the following buttons on login since we need to allow for the
following methods for reaching the login.

Explain reasoning.
