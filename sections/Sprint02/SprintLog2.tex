\chapter{Sprint: 02}
Following the first sprint, each group has gained a deeper understanding of how
the individual applications are designed and implemented. Based on this
knowledge, this sprint will be used to further develop the features which were
worked on by the previous semester's students.\nl

While our initial area of responsibility were focused on the \textc{Launcher}
and \textc{Pictogram Searcher}, for this sprint we have chosen to expand this to
also include the \textc{Pictogram Reader} and developing a new \textc{Login
System}. This choice is based on the fact, that currently only two groups are
working on developing the front-end for applications (SW609 and SW610), and our
group is currently best suited to handle these new tasks. Additionally, through
a discussion with the other groups, we have concluded that our projects should
include documenting the applications/classes we are working on. This
documentation should be added to the GIRAF wiki.

\section{Tasks}
Based on our expanded area of responsibility and the need to develop a new login
system, we have been assigned the tasks presented in \autoref{SprintTwoTasks}.
