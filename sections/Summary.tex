In this report, we present our work
on the GIRAF multi-project which was started in 2011. It is a
collaborative software development project shared between the Software bachelor
students at Aalborg University. The GIRAF multi-project is focused on developing
a suite of applications for Android tablets, which are aimed at supporting
autistic citizens in planning and structuring their daily lives.\\
Due to the scale of the project, the development has spanned across multiple
years, with numerous project groups. The project is focused on code maintenance
and developing a complex software system in a larger development
environment.\nl

The project development is shared between 7 groups of up to 4 people.
These groups are organized using the SCRUM of SCRUMs organizational approach, in
which each group has a SCRUM representative which engages with other
representatives in order to organize the project direction at weekly SCRUM
meetings. In addition to these weekly SCRUM meetings, the project tasks are
planned at sprint meetings at the start of each sprint, in which all members of
the project participates.\nl

The project is split into four sprints, which each has a specified
set of tasks and a defined sprint goal. The tasks range from implementing
specific features, researching possible solutions, planning meetings, writing
development guides, and refactoring old code. The tasks themselves are based on
user feedback, internal discussion, and the backlog from last year's
students.\nl

The main focus for this semester is to replace the server-to-client
communications framework, as it is of insufficient quality to be used for any
further development. This new framework makes use of the constraints
defined in the \textc{REST} (Representational State Transfer) model.\\
Our group's responsibility is to improve and
repair the \textc{Launcher} application, and the libraries it is dependent
upon.
As such, we have to familiarize ourselves with the \textc{Giraf-Component-Lib}
library and the \textc{Launcher} application to the point where we are capable
of replacing the current backend with the \textc{REST} client and server
developed by other project groups. Based on this responsibility, this report is focused on
the implementation of the new \textc{REST-Api-Client-Lib} library, and the
preparatory work needed in order to complete this process.\nl

In general, most of the semester was spent preparing for the finalization of the
\textc{REST} framework, such that it could be implemented in the
\textc{Launcher} and \textc{Giraf-Component-Lib}.\\
The first sprint is used to familiarize ourselves with the GIRAF code base by
refactoring the \textc{Launcher}, \textc{Giraf-Component-Lib} and
\textc{PictoSearch-Lib}. It allowed us to increase the code quality, and to make
sure that the code used a consistent style. We also began fixing a number of
bugs, which were passed on to us through the backlog of the previous year's
students.\nl



In the second sprint, we worked on fixed some security issues, discussed design
decisions with other groups, and fixed more bugs. During the second sprint, our
build tools broke down, which prevented us from building our project. Due to
this problem, the second sprint was spent developing potential solutions to
problems defined by the GIRAF users. Additionally, we designed a new login
screen based on user feedback.\nl

For the third sprint, we were tasked with helping to restore our build tools,
and to implement a grayscale option for the GIRAF GUI. During the third sprint,
our build tools became operational once again, and we could begin to implement
the new login screen and the grayscale option. Additionally, we began to remove
the old server-to-client communication in order to prepare for the new
\textc{REST} framework.\nl

The final sprint was focused on implementing a beta version of the
\\\textc{REST-Api-Client-Lib} into the \textc{Launcher} application and the
\textc{Giraf-Component-Lib} library. As the \textc{REST-Api-Client-Lib} did not
contain all necessary functionality, parts of the sprint were also spent holding
meetings with the other groups in order to determine the final design of the
\textc{REST} framework. Additionally, we have delegated \textc{PictoSearch-Lib}
to group SW612. This sprint ended with the \textc{Launcher} in a mostly finished
state, and \textc{Giraf-Component-Lib} in a finished state. The functionality
missing from the \textc{Launcher} is due to the partly unfinished state of the
\textc{REST} framework.\nl

In conclusion, we have managed to familiarize ourselves with a larger existing
code base. We have managed to implement a new login system, where the design was
based on user feedback. We have also implemented a grayscale
functionality in the \textc{Launcher}. We have also familiarized ourselves
with our build tools (Artifactory, Gradle, and Jenkins), and how to manage these tools in
a project setting. Finally, we have implemented the \textc{REST} framework into
the \textc{Launcher} and the \textc{Giraf-Component-Lib} library.
